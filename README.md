# Some important packages are:

    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn

# STEPS?

    First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com Link for data:
    https://github.com/ankitmishra067/Used-car-price-prediction

    The data was cleaned  and analysed.

    Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.85 R2_score.

    Link for notebook: https://github.com/ankitmishra067/Used-car-price-prediction/blob/main/predictor.ipynb

    This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
